## Home Project

Write an application that will display a donut view which pulls the credit score information from the endpoint given. The image below shows an example of what is to be achieved. The donut should display the correct value received from the endpoint.

## Notes

The App was designed from a minimalist point of view, displaying only what it is truly necessary for the user.

- Architectured using MVVM
- Dounut progress bar with progressive colours upon completion
